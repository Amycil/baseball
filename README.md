# Baseball Players Analysis

- I collected this data from kaggle. It consists of the names, height, weight, age and positions and team played by baseball players.
- My aim was to find the relationship among the various variables, thus the relationship between age and weight, age and height, weight and height, positions played, weight ad height.
- I made use of data visualization and calculated the correlation coefficients between the variables to check for strong or weak correlation among the variables.

Again, a really simple project. Still buildig momentum for more complex ones. I will update soon!!
